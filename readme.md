<!-- Express session -->

Express Session is a middleware tool used in Node.js to store the session data of the user in memory, cookies, or other stores. It helps us to track the user's request and provide the appropriate response whenever you require it. Express Session helps maintain a login session between multiple requests and also helps avoid any tampering of the stored session data.
